                About Me
            </header>
            
            <p>
                Hey there, this is my About Me page, so let's get down to it or me in this case :D. My name is Daniel Pardoe and as you can probably tell from the website that I am an aspiring Game/Software Developer, this is something that I have been interested in since I had my first Gaming PC in Year 9 of Secondary School. This was when I first started to play PC games and it had always fascinated me how these games came to be, however, what sparked more interest was a game called Crysis, this games was one of the best looking games at the time and I loved it, not only for the graphics but also the gameplay and the levels themselves as each level was open world and you could effectively do each mission your way. This game also came with the Cryengine 2 Editor, this was the fisrt engine that I started to create various levels in, granted these were not that great in design and overall look, and I did also use the inbuilt assets from the Crysis game, but it was a start and my interest in the level design and even asset creation started to grow. Not long after Crysis 2 was released along with the Cryengine 3 Editor, I did use this editor a tiny bit but did not get much of a chance as I started to focus more on my GCSE’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                As said above there was a time I did not touch an engine as around this time I was focusing on my GCSE’s and didn’t really have the time to focus on this topic. I was also working on getting a Virtual Machine lab built, so that I could learn most Operating Systems and services within a safe and non-vital environment. After my GCSE’s were completed I went onto a Level 2 Systems Support course, this is where I did my first bit of programming, granted it was Windows Form Applications and they was made using the VB language, but I still enjoyed it and wanted to learn more language and learn how to program my own games. So at the end of this course I started another course but this time a Level 3 Extended Diploma in IT, and I chose to do the Software Design and Development side of the qualification. This is where I learnt most of the knowledge I know now, from more programming skills to 3D Modelling and certain engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, when I completed this course I did not stop doing programming or even the level design, as you can tell from the other pages on the site I still am doing level design and am uploading content on a regular basis, as it is something that I love to do. Currently I am working on a HNC qualification in IT, which I have done some more programming most notably C++. So, to stay up to date with all of my future and even past content then please follow me on the social media platforms below, and don't forget to click on the bell icon for my YouTube channel so you are notified whenever I upload a new video. Links to all of my social media pages are at the bottom of all of the pages.
